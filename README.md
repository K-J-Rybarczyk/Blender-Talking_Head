#Talking Heads - Blender Addon
----

###What it is?

This is an addon for Blender of course (and part of my thesis). This is a pack of simple tools to make work with lip-sync easier. Currently Blender don't have any 100% working automatic lip-sync system like Voice-o-Matic for example. No, no, no, this plugin is not a 100% working tool too. This is rather a basic equipment to develop in the future. I have hope that maybe someone will interest in subject and we will have some true, big, one in million system of automatic lip-sync in Blender in some time. Now, we have THIS! :D Talking Heads!

Ah, you ask, why "Talking Heads"? It is in a memory of victim of my hard work with this addon - Head.blend. You can find her here too, she is especially good, when you want to try how my plugin works - she was made mainly with my addon. The name is in a memory of Talking Heads from Fallouts games too - If you have ever play Fallout 1 or 2, you know what I talking about.

But now, go on to important things.

###How work with this?
