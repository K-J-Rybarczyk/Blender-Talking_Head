Hi there!

If you already check the dictionary file you know, that crazy things are there. But in fact, it is not so hard. I just "translate" some of english phonemic symbols to "normal" letters. Here is a list (I have hope, that you can read this):

ɪ	->	i
i:	->	ee
ʊ	->	oo
ʌ	->	u
æ	->	a
ɒ	->	o
u:	->	ue
e	->	e
ə	->	er
ɜ:	->	ur
ɔ:	->	au
a:	->	ar
ɪə	->	ear
eə	->	air
əʊ	->	oe
aʊ	->	ow
eɪ	->	ae
aɪ	->	ie
ɔɪ	->	oi
ʊə	->	ure

ŋ	->	ng
ʒ	->	zh
ʃ	->	sh
tʃ	->	ch
θ	->	th
ð	->	wh
dʒ	->	j
j	->	y

The others phonemic symbols like "m", "k", "f" of course are still the same.
